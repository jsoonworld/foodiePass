# FoodiePass 🌮🍜🌍

> **Scan, See, Taste. Instantly understand any foreign menu with translations, currency conversion, and food photos.**

FoodiePass is designed for every traveler who has ever hesitated to order from a menu in a foreign language. It's more than just a translator; it's a visual guide to your next great meal. Simply take a picture of the menu, and our OCR technology will serve you a fully understandable menu with translations, converted prices, and pictures of the dishes.

## About The Project

**Go beyond translation to visualization. See what you're ordering before it arrives.**

One of the greatest joys of traveling is tasting local food. However, language barriers and text-only menus can turn an exciting opportunity into a guessing game. FoodiePass was created to solve this problem.

We eliminate the uncertainty by not only translating the menu and converting the currency but also by showing you **vibrant photos of the food**. Users no longer need to imagine what a dish looks like. Instead, they can browse visually, order with confidence, and truly enjoy their dining experience, just like using a modern food delivery app.

## Core Features

* **Instant Menu Scan**: Capture any menu, and our OCR engine instantly extracts the dishes and prices.
* **Real-time Translation**: Menu items are immediately translated into your preferred language.
* **Live Currency Conversion**: See prices in your home currency, calculated with up-to-date exchange rates.
* **Food Photo Display**: Don't just read the name—see a photo of the dish to know exactly what you're ordering.
* **Allergen & Ingredient Info**: We provide detailed food descriptions, including potential allergens and main ingredients, to help you make safe and informed choices.
* **Easy Ordering & Customization**: Add items to your cart, adjust quantities, and select custom options through a user-friendly interface. Finalize your order and show the generated script to the waiter.

## Goal

To empower any traveler, in any restaurant worldwide, to enjoy the delightful experience of food without barriers. Our mission is to make FoodiePass an essential and joyful companion for every culinary journey.

Our user flow is designed to be simple and intuitive, guiding you from confusion to confident ordering in just a few steps.

1.  **Set Up Your Trip**
    On the home screen, select your travel destination, your preferred language, and the local currency. This ensures all translations and conversions are tailored to your journey.

    > 홈 화면에서 여행지, 선호 언어, 현지 화폐를 선택합니다. 이를 통해 모든 번역과 환율 변환이 당신의 여행에 맞춰집니다.

2.  **Scan the Local Menu**
    Take a clear photo of the restaurant's menu. Our OCR technology is optimized to read item names and prices, which are essential for the next step.

    > 레스토랑의 메뉴판을 선명하게 촬영합니다. OCR 기술은 다음 단계를 위해 필수적인 메뉴 이름과 가격을 읽는 데 최적화되어 있습니다.

3.  **Get Your Digital Menu**
    Instantly, FoodiePass scans, translates, and converts the menu content. It then generates a new, user-friendly digital menu in your language, displaying converted prices and—most importantly—vibrant photos of each dish.

    > 즉시 FoodiePass가 메뉴 내용을 스캔, 번역 및 변환합니다. 변환된 가격과 각 요리의 생생한 사진이 포함된 사용자 친화적인 디지털 메뉴가 당신의 언어와 선호 화폐로 생성됩니다.

4.  **Build Your Order**
    Browse the visual menu and add items to your cart. You can view detailed information for each dish, including ingredients and allergen warnings, and customize your selections.

    > 시각적인 메뉴를 둘러보고 장바구니에 음식을 담습니다. 재료 및 알레르기 유발 물질 정보를 포함한 각 요리의 상세 정보를 확인하고, 주문을 맞춤 설정할 수 있습니다.

5.  **Checkout with Confidence**
    When you're ready to order, the app generates a split-screen view. One side shows the final order summary in the local language and currency for the staff, while the other side displays a receipt in your language for your reference. This eliminates any communication barrier and ensures your order is placed correctly.

    > 주문할 준비가 되면, 앱은 분할 화면을 생성합니다. 한쪽에는 현지 직원을 위한 현지 언어와 화폐로 된 최종 주문서가, 다른 한쪽에는 사용자를 위한 영수증이 표시됩니다. 이를 통해 언어 장벽 없이 정확한 주문이 가능합니다.
