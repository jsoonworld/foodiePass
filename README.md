# FoodiePass 🌮🍜🌍

> **Scan, See, Taste. Instantly understand any foreign menu with translations, currency conversion, and food photos.**

FoodiePass is designed for every traveler who has ever hesitated to order from a menu in a foreign language. It's more than just a translator; it's a visual guide to your next great meal. Simply take a picture of the menu, and our OCR technology will serve you a fully understandable menu with translations, converted prices, and pictures of the dishes.

## About The Project

**Go beyond translation to visualization. See what you're ordering before it arrives.**

One of the greatest joys of traveling is tasting local food. However, language barriers and text-only menus can turn an exciting opportunity into a guessing game. FoodiePass was created to solve this problem.

We eliminate the uncertainty by not only translating the menu and converting the currency but also by showing you **vibrant photos of the food**. Users no longer need to imagine what a dish looks like. Instead, they can browse visually, order with confidence, and truly enjoy their dining experience, just like using a modern food delivery app.

## Core Features

* **Instant Menu Scan**: Capture any menu, and our OCR engine instantly extracts the dishes and prices.
* **Real-time Translation**: Menu items are immediately translated into your preferred language.
* **Live Currency Conversion**: See prices in your home currency, calculated with up-to-date exchange rates.
* **Food Photo Display**: Don't just read the name—see a photo of the dish to know exactly what you're ordering.
* **Allergen & Ingredient Info**: We provide detailed food descriptions, including potential allergens and main ingredients, to help you make safe and informed choices.
* **Easy Ordering & Customization**: Add items to your cart, adjust quantities, and select custom options through a user-friendly interface. Finalize your order and show the generated script to the waiter.

## Goal

To empower any traveler, in any restaurant worldwide, to enjoy the delightful experience of food without barriers. Our mission is to make FoodiePass an essential and joyful companion for every culinary journey.
